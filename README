Virginia DOT makes available live information on plows clearing snow and ice
at http://vdotplows.org.  There is an advanced interface that is disabled by
default, but that this Chrome extension enables.  It allows access to more
information about the trucks, forcing a refresh, changing the default
refresh time and more.

To use this in Chrome, you need to go into the Extensions menu
(chrome://extensions) and load this directory with the "Load unpacked
extension..." option.
