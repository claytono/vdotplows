Virginia DOT makes available live information on plows clearing snow and ice
at http://vdotplows.org.  There is an advanced interface that is disabled by
default, but that this Chrome extension enables.  It allows access to more
information about the trucks, forcing a refresh, changing the default
refresh time and more.
